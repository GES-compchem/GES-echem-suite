    "The core of all the data-loading operations is the `FileManager` class defined in the `read_input` submodule. The `FileManager` class can load both `.DTA` and `.mpt` files generated respectively by the GAMRY and BIOLOGIC potentiostats. The class provides a simple interface to automatically parse all the loaded data holding them in memory in the form of bytestreams. To show how this object can be operated let us consider the case of a `.mpt` file that, for the purposes of this example, is provided in the documentation folder. Let us look at the content of such file:"
