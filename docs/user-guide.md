# User guide

The `GES-echem-suite` library articulates in two submodules: The `echemsuite.cellcycling` module, dedicated to the analysis of cell-cycling experiments, and the `echemsuite.cyclicvoltammetry` module, dedicated to the analysis of cyclic voltammetry esperiments.

This user guide will walk the user through the basic operations required to load an experimental file, accessing the contained data and computing the main derived quantities. This guide is organized as follows:

* [Structure of the `echemsuite.cellcycling` module](CellCyclingModule)
  * [Loading a cycling experimental file](CellCycling_Loading)
  * [Acessing the experimental data and derived quantities](CellCycling_AccessingData)

* Structure of the `echemsuite.cyclicvoltammetry` module
