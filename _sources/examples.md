The `GES-echem-suite` library is shipped with a small set of example scripts that cover the main data-analysis tasks. The main idea around these scripts is to provide a well formatted starting point for all the users that want to develop their own data-analysis routines to respond to well defined research interests.

The following examples are provided:

* [Plotting the charge and discharge cycles from `.mpt` or `.DTA` files](Examples-plot-cycles)
* [Plotting rate experiments from various sources](Examples-plot-rate-experiments)
* [Plotting cyclic voltammetry experiments](Examples-plot-cyclicvoltammetry)
