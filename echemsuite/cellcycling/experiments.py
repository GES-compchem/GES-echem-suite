class RateExperiment:

    The RateExperiment class provides a simple interface to charge rate experiments in which a cell is charged and
    discharged at different constant current values and the voltage and charge time are recorded and monitored. The
    class can be constructed manually, using the __init__ method, providing the list of single current steps and the list
    of cell-cycling experiments carried out at a given current. The class can also be constructed using the
    `from_Biologic_battery_module` classmethod that is setup to be able to directly parse Biologic modules sequences.

    Arguments

    cellcycling_steps: List[CellCycling]
        The list of CellCycling objects encoding the measurement done at a given current.

    ------
    RuntimeError
        Exception raised if a mismatch in lenght is detected between the given lists.
